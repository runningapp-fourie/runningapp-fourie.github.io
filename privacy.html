<h1>Privacy Policy for Fourie</h1>

<p><strong>Last Updated: December 16, 2025</strong></p>

<p>Fourie is a running tracking app built by running enthusiasts. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains our data practices for the Fourie application (the "App").</p>

<p><strong>We do not collect, store, or share any personal data from users of the App.</strong></p>

<p>All run data—including GPS location, distance, pace, splits, laps, heart rate (if connected), VO2 Max estimates, and any other fitness metrics—is stored exclusively on your device and is never transmitted to us or any third party.</p>

<h2>1. Data We Do Not Collect</h2>

<p>To be clear, Fourie does not collect, process, or transmit:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Any personal identifiers (name, email, account information)</li>
    <li>Location or GPS data beyond what is temporarily used on your device during a run</li>
    <li>Health or fitness data (heart rate, pace, distance, etc.) outside of your device</li>
    <li>Device identifiers or usage analytics</li>
    <li>Crash reports or diagnostic data</li>
    <li>Any data for advertising, marketing, or analytics purposes</li>
</ul>

<p>The App stores your run data through HealthKit on your device.</p>

<h2>2. Permissions Requested</h2>

<p>The App may request certain device permissions to function properly:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Required for GPS tracking during runs. Data is used only in real-time on your device and is not stored or transmitted anywhere.</li>
    <li><strong>Motion & Fitness / Health:</strong> For heart rate monitoring and other activity data. All processing happens locally.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can revoke these permissions at any time in your device settings without affecting previously recorded runs stored on your device.</p>

<h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>

<p>All your run data is stored securely on your devices through HealthKit only. You can manager the data using the Health app.</p>

<p>Since no data is transmitted or stored by us, there is no remote server involvement.</p>

<h2>4. Third Parties</h2>

<p>We do not share any data with third parties because we do not collect any data. The App does not integrate with external services for analytics, advertising, or cloud storage.</p>

<h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted here with an updated "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

<p>Thank you for using Fourie!</p>
